AI CMD ASSISTANT - USER MANUAL
OVERVIEW
An intelligent Windows command-line assistant that automatically troubleshoots
failed commands using local AI (Ollama phi3) and cloud AI (Google Gemini).

BASIC COMMANDS
exit / quit Exit the assistant history Display all previously executed commands !<number> Re-run a command from history (e.g., !3 runs command #3)

HOW IT WORKS
Type any Windows CMD command
If it fails, the assistant:
Checks local knowledge base for similar errors
Attempts fix with local phi3 model
Escalates to Gemini if local fix doesn't help
Successful fixes are saved to knowledge base for future use
FEATURES
[Smart Error Resolution]

Automatically detects command failures
Provides detailed error explanations
Suggests corrected commands
Learns from past fixes
[Knowledge Base]

Stores all successful solutions
Uses fuzzy matching to find similar errors
Tracks success rate of each solution
Persists across sessions (knowledge_base.json)
[Safety Features]

Warns before executing dangerous commands
Detects: format, del /s, rd /s, rmdir /s, deltree
Requires explicit confirmation to proceed
[Command History]

Stores all executed commands in current session
Quick recall with !<number> syntax
View full history with 'history' command
[Dual AI System]

Local Model: Ollama phi3 (fast, offline)
Cloud Model: Google Gemini (advanced, online)
Automatic fallback if local model unavailable
[Intelligent Escalation]

Tries local solution first
Asks for user feedback
Escalates to Gemini if needed
Allows user to provide additional context
[System Context Awareness]

Includes OS version in troubleshooting
Considers current working directory
Platform-specific solutions
[Logging]

All operations logged to cmd_ai_assistant.log
Tracks command success/failure
Records model used for each fix
Timestamps all events
EXAMPLE WORKFLOW
cmd-ai> dir /invalid-flag

Command failed.
Error:
Invalid switch - "invalid-flag".

Attempting local fix using phi3...

Suggested Fix (Local):
The command failed because '/invalid-flag' is not a valid dir switch.
The correct command should be: dir
Valid switches include /w, /p, /s, /a, /b, etc.

Did this fix help? (y/n): y

[Solution saved to knowledge base]

REQUIREMENTS
Python 3.7+
Ollama with phi3 model installed
Google Gemini API key (set GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable)
Required packages: ollama, langchain-google-genai
FILE STRUCTURE
knowledge_base.json       Stores learned solutions
cmd_ai_assistant.log      Operation logs
ai_cmd_assistant.py       Main program

TIPS
Always review suggested fixes before executing them
Use 'y' feedback to train the knowledge base
Provide context when escalating for better solutions
Check the log file for debugging
Knowledge base improves with usage
SAFETY NOTES
Always verify destructive commands before confirmation
The assistant cannot prevent all dangerous operations
Review suggested fixes before executing
Backup important data before running unfamiliar commands
TROUBLESHOOTING
[Local model not responding]

Verify Ollama is running
Check phi3 model is installed: ollama list
Assistant will auto-fallback to Gemini
[Gemini API errors]

Verify GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable is set
Check API key is valid and has quota
Check internet connection
[Knowledge base corruption]

Delete knowledge_base.json to reset
Assistant will create new file automatically
